finally demolished at the close of the decade.

<h2>Deadly Pollen</h2>

<div class="chapter">

<p class="poem">
<a name="chap01"></a>ZIONISM:<br/>
to carry forward the cultural gene -<br/>
O bright-lit destiny of the chosen!<br/>
The child&rsquo;s bouncing ball lands in mud<br/>
on the other side of the wire;<br/>
footsteps are paradoxical in a minefield.<br/>
His heart ticks fast as a metal detector,<br/>
slowly, the yellow ball rolls to a stop.<br/>
Proposition: to advance onto ancestral<br/>
territory, or return into gentle, familial lands,<br/>
a footfall journey backward. His eye<br/>
shrinks the land to desert.<br/>

<p class="poem">
<a name="chap02"></a>You return to the stupa, yearly,<br/>
to seek your return. You wish to<br/>
come back as forest deer but<br/>
that deer is extinct. The stupa is a rock<br/>
upon which your dreams founder,<br/>
yearly, - you return that which<br/>
you do not have. Meanwhile, in the<br/>
West, under ragged skies and beneath a<br/>
hundred spires no longer dreamt of -<br/>
attendance comes tumbling down;<br/>
each stone, unturned, in an emptied<br/>
space within a space caved under.<br/>

<p class="poem">
<a name="chap03"></a>The stones collected. Ground<br/>
levelled and swept. The first cubicle<br/>
erected with four windowed-walls,<br/>
an open doorway. One man<br/>
on a step looking out to sea. Civilization<br/>
open for business. Soon, marble<br/>
was made smooth and square. The Idea<br/>
locked into permanence. Curiosity<br/>
stimulated commerce; others came and<br/>
conquered then went away.<br/>
That first step never forgotten became<br/>
a throne - history&rsquo;s seat.<br/>

<p class="poem">
<a name="chap04"></a>&ldquo;With digital, there is no past,&rdquo;<br/>
says Jean-Luc Godard. Either way,<br/>
the button is redundant. Voice-command<br/>
is thought - the fear deep and futureless<br/>
as history, desire to appease which<br/>
remains featureless, not the disorganized<br/>
weather it truly is, as much a part of<br/>
the breathing stars as constancy of rock.<br/>
The &lsquo;Mr Whippy Man&rsquo; weaves<br/>
Greensleeves in and out of suburbia; a<br/>
caravan in search of a trade-route -<br/>
via the village that never existed.<br/>

<p class="poem">
<a name="chap05"></a>How is it the floating island<br/>
detaches itself from horizon in dream -<br/>
its first appearance, otherworldly,<br/>
but of this world, a wheel loosened<br/>
from the world&rsquo;s ratchet, out of time,<br/>
riding above it and inhabited by<br/>
folk fixated upon a particular<br/>
theorem-thought; elevated imponderables,<br/>
whereby you access this island by door<br/>
set underneath as you sail under?<br/>
Islands, a dream of round towers!<br/>
the sudden rush of water under hulls.<br/>

<p class="poem">
<a name="chap06"></a>Mediocre raiders lie in wait.<br/>
Teeth clack in sleep, dreams fraught<br/>
with ambush. Orders intercepted,<br/>
encrypted to the house style.<br/>
The litterateur tracked back through<br/>
his ISBN to no man&rsquo;s land -<br/>
the robotic verb activated, sent<br/>
in under barbed metaphor strung out<br/>
where trees once stood as<br/>
camouflage. The voices from his<br/>
hill-bunker a wind turbine. Accusations<br/>
tumbled in the night. For months he<br/>
heard soft hammering, mimicry;<br/>
they failed. Could not beat back the<br/>
weather on his chosen ground.<br/>

<p class="poem">
<a name="chap07"></a>Time passes - that pressure in<br/>
space again - return of the unoriginals<br/>
tinkering with the power-box -<br/>
such fine work - setting traps out<br/>
for darkness. Time passes -<br/>
talons curve and hook - how the<br/>
mouth chokes with ash. Feet drag<br/>
muffled under dungeons. Time passes -<br/>
that pressure in space again - a<br/>
new proclamation from Semiotic City -<br/>
this custom built dome and<br/>
aquarium light, pulsing: henceforth,<br/>
no corners to hide around - no zone<br/>
permitted for surprise to leap.<br/>

<p class="poem">
<a name="chap08"></a>Hugely, our indifference squats -<br/>
unleavened as fear, blood is contained<br/>
within news footage. Archaeologists<br/>
stop digging deserts because of<br/>
landmines. Camels wait for sand dunes<br/>
to drift into ridges - blue flags flutter<br/>
back at Fort Apache on brave<br/>
white trucks (what gets through<br/>
is the scent of coffee). A footless boy<br/>
hobbles past, bargain hunting,<br/>
a life at odds &amp; ends - smoke drifts<br/>
over Manhattan, out across the Hudson<br/>
river as from a Bedouin campfire.<br/>

the Milesians on their last leg to<br/>
Ireland as the first Celts castaway -<br/>
whose home precinct the Black Sea,<br/>
the right hand to the centre;<br/>
memoried in standing stone circles.<br/>
Yet homage to a sun as walking<br/>
pillar of fire, with hell for a coronet?<br/>
The world&rsquo;s breath and mystery<br/>

<a name="chap10"></a>If streets had cobblestones<br/>
blood would flow in tatters - torn<br/>
flags to a revolution lost. Streets<br/>
smoothly ease to drains. The cut deep,<br/>
and blood wakes from its blackness,<br/>
crushed as berries in the runnels<br/>
of a wagon, oozes its oil from<br/>
the body&rsquo;s casket - til flesh becomes<br/>
porcelain, perfect surface for moon,<br/>
ice, the glass-edged sky to play upon;<br/>
in silences deep as birch in the<br/>
bayoneting dark - and leaves finally<br/>
resemble paper money piled up<br/>

An Actual Encounter With The Sun On
                  My Balcony At France Street

        ( for Gloria Schwartz )


When the moon slipped its knot
and left a ring for the night to drop
through, and a baggage of stars
thudded on the loading bay
at the other side of the world,


                                I heard,
&ldquo;Ho! get up you slack-arse poet,
I want to have a word with you.&rdquo;


                It was the sun.


&ldquo;This is a surprise,&rdquo; I yawned.


&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t be - you&rsquo;re the one whose
been whingeing about his own personal light.&rdquo;


                &ldquo;I must admit,&rdquo; I conceded, &ldquo;I
was worried there for a bit.&rdquo;


                &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; answered
the sun. He spat at the window turning
it molten.


&ldquo;You must know by now Stephen,
I visit with a poet every thirty years or so.
Last time it was Frank O&rsquo;Hara,


                                and before that,
Mayakovsky. Can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s your turn
but I&rsquo;ll stop by anyway.


You&rsquo;re not a poet for all time but
for your own time. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.


And forget those supposed poets
the M=E=Z=Z=A=N=I=N=E=S as you call them


caught between the floors: they ain&rsquo;t going
nowhere.


        So get up and make a cup of tea!&rdquo;


                &ldquo;Sure, care to join me?&rdquo;


&ldquo;Only for a minute,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got more
important things to do today, like glinting
off the Hauraki Gulf and the iron-clad poppy
of Sydney Tower.


                Oh, that reminds me,
then I&rsquo;m off to San Francisco to wake up that
ex-girlfriend of yours you keep pissing
off with late night calls and false promises.&rdquo;


                        By now I could
see the sun was pretty worked up.


&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, forget that crap.
You write some good stuff but you&rsquo;ve got to
hang in there, and like me it&rsquo;ll
come to light.&rdquo;


                &ldquo;Thanks sun.&rdquo;


&ldquo;And knock off the guilt trips and stop
getting pissed (in your Sydney dreams, pal!) you&rsquo;ll
burn yourself out - I recognise the signs.&rdquo;


                &ldquo;Yeah, seems I have been
a little preoccupied.&rdquo;


                The sun jumped onto my balcony
outside the window.


&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see much of me down here at
POETS&rsquo; PALACE - do you?

Move over,
this is the only time I get a look in.&rdquo;


                I propped myself up
on one elbow.


                &ldquo;Remember, you&rsquo;re not
writing bus-timetables and calling it
&lsquo;performance poetry&rsquo; like a few I
could name. Stick with the atmospherics,
the true essence of people.


That&rsquo;s your angle, as mine is now
to brow beat you.


And don&rsquo;t get into this doomsday kick
either, leave such things to the        (small minded).


                Honestly,
it&rsquo;s straight forward focus.&rdquo;


                By now my hangover had
evaporated.


                &ldquo;Hold on sun,
I&rsquo;ve a few questions.&rdquo;


&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; called the sun, receding.


&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had our little talk. Give my regards
to Greece again, if you ever get there.&rdquo;


                And he was gone
                                and I got up to
another beginning, and a day.

Stephen Oliver Deadly Pollen [Middletown NJ: Word Riot Press, 2003]; and
Ballads, Satire &amp; Salt [Sydney: Greywacke Press, 2003]. Review by Nicholas
Reid. First Appeared: JAS Review of Books.
</p>

<p>
Stephen Oliver&rsquo;s anthology of 2001, Night of Warehouses, brought together the
work of a poet who combines an astonishing facility for image with a complete
assurance of voice, while showing a deep engagement with the poetic tradition .
 Two new collections, Ballads, Satire &amp; Salt and Deadly Pollen, will do much to
extend that reputation. The former is subtitled &lsquo;A Book of Diversions&rsquo; and
displays Oliver&rsquo;s sardonic wit and verbal inventiveness, along with a fine
set of illustrations by Matt Ottley. The book&rsquo;s light verse moves from
political satire (&lsquo;Think Big&rsquo;) to a series of reflections on the poets of this
and the last generation, ranging from Larkin and Auden to the major figures in
recent New Zealand writing. Wit explained is wit ruined, however, and so I
shall not comment at length on what is an impressive work.
</p>

<p>
Oliver&rsquo;s other new collection, Deadly Pollen, is an ambitious undertaking - a
meditation, in large measure, on Wallace Stevens and his legacy - and brings
together thirty-five short lyrics into a loosely linked sequence which examines
the state of the world after 9/11. And the poem is not &lsquo;merely&rsquo; political, for
it diagnoses a state of spiritual malaise based on fear, a state of crisis in
which the role of the poet is in question. So far, so good. But if this is a
crisis poem, it is also a crisis in which (and this is my reservation) I find
it difficult to believe, though it has been the subject of much recent American
commentary. And in any case, there is also an enormous amount to admire in the
language and in the range of reference.
</p>

<p>
I can convey something of the fineness of Oliver&rsquo;s craftsmanship in his
translation of Horace&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pyrrha&rsquo; ode, a translation which fits into Oliver&rsquo;s
theme of disillusionment, and of his modernist distrust of beauty in person and
in diction. The quiet intensity, and the distanced, almost intellectualized
sensuality, of the language in which Oliver brings alive the golden-haired
Pyrrha, Horace&rsquo;s femme fatale, is perfect:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Pyrrha, your dewy hair,<br/>
yellow, scented, doubly wreathed<br/>
in Jasmine, fresh from the trellis<br/>
this morning.... (lyric 12)<br/>
</p>

<p>
Nor is Oliver&rsquo;s ambition here  as limited as it might seem, for in taking on
such a translation Oliver is setting himself up against a history of
translations,  and most notably one by Milton. It is a challenge in which he
succeeds admirably.  And in the later lines of the lyric,  Oliver marks his
disengagement  by a withdrawal into a more demotic register.  For while he is
adept at finding occasion for the lyrical richness of which modernism was
always suspicious, he also writes at times in a spare modern voice,  as in the
following lines which may owe something to the New Zealand poet Curnow&rsquo;s &lsquo;Canto
of Signs&rsquo;:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Rubbed off sky exposes an<br/>
undercoat of white that is really<br/>
fuzzed, mid-day heat. Birds <br/>
change over shifts. Things settle.<br/>
Shadow drops under eaves, tier<br/>
by tier .... (lyric 32)<br/>
</p>

<p>
The language here has a powerful antipodean flatness, and depends on its
laconic pauses. And if &lsquo;things settle&rsquo;, it is because, as the allusion to Yeats
suggests,  things are about to fall apart;  and we move to images of Bali.
Oliver goes on in a following lyric to demonstrate his gift for image, in his
intense visualization of Spring&rsquo;s strange bloom, the terrorist&rsquo;s bomb:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Compression of bees,<br/>
shrub-shaped, in proton loops,<br/>
on cushioned air. Spring!<br/>
See the counter, its bright ticking<br/>
with fail-safe growth. (lyric 34)
</p>

<p>
Political poets do not always manage to capture so well the estrangement which
is necessary for successful social comment.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, Oliver demonstrates an unsettled verbal mastery in a bravura
display, a  description of architectural form:
</p>

<p class="poem">
... Complex of<br/>
accented runs, angles, drops, sluices,<br/>
pumps, ditches, endless unbowed<br/>
archways... (lyric 11)<br/>
</p>

<p>
The language here is finely controlled,  from the way in which the &lsquo;x&rsquo; sound is
perfectly balanced in the opening phrase, to the series of falling
monosyllables which are released in the enjambed expansiveness of the final
phrase with its open vowels. The language is reminiscent of Les Murray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bent
Water&rsquo; (surely Murray&rsquo;s masterpiece). But the lines I have just quoted continue
in rhythms which, while still lyrical, are also more unsettling: &lsquo;archways,
treatment ponds breaking into/sunlight&rsquo;. For where Murray&rsquo;s language embodies a
confident belief in God, Oliver&rsquo;s has been a celebration of a public sewer -
and more to the point, a sewer envisioned but (in an act of creative failure)
never built.
</p>

<p>
Late in the poem,  Oliver  brings together these themes in a grim reflection
upon the role of the poet - in a voice in which the emotion is italicized but
never allowed to run outside its bounds:
</p>

<p class="poem">
One quadrant of sky turns,<br/>
face up, black as the ace of spades.<br/>
Much as a God can manage<br/>
muttering from the side of his mouth.<br/>
Star flecks, nova spittle. Rage of<br/>
emptiness pours through, for the hell<br/>
of it, endlessly. Looking back to<br/>
what beginning. The whole shebang<br/>
advances toward, beyond our<br/>
best efforts. We live under a Niagra<br/>
of star fall, huge optics dilate time,<br/>
blackness like velvet slips over<br/>
chrome. Sounds of nothingness<br/>
strung between a singlet of lights.  (lyric 30).<br/>
</p>

<p>
This is vintage Oliver. The language is elaborate, but perfectly judged,
undercut by a colloquial impulse (&lsquo;black as the ace of spades&rsquo;, &lsquo;for the hell
/ of it&rsquo;). This undersong speaks of Oliver&rsquo;s awareness of his place as a poet
of the vernacular republic; but it also speaks, in its use of cliche, of a loss
of faith in the resources of poetic language.
</p>

<p>
And something similar can be said of its use of Stevens, for where Stevens is
the poet who brought romantic metaphysics to its final crisis, and with it the
end of any hope of finding essential meaning in the world, Oliver&rsquo;s use of
Stevens here seems also an act of deliberate failure. The stanza alludes to
Stevens&rsquo;s Jove, a false divinity who &lsquo;moved among us, as a muttering king&rsquo; in
&lsquo;Sunday Morning&rsquo;, and to that poem&rsquo;s existential conclusion that (contra
Milton) &lsquo;We live in an old chaos of the sun&rsquo;. Like Stevens in &lsquo;Key West&rsquo;,
Oliver laments the &lsquo;Blessed rage for order&rsquo;, the &lsquo;glassy lights&rsquo; which gave a
bogus sense of structure to the sea. But in a sense, and an important sense, 
much of the language of Oliver&rsquo;s stanza is the language of Stevens: it is an
eloquent testament to a failure to find in the present a viable voice for
poetry.
</p>

<p>
Clearly there is much in this sequence which I find powerful, and respond to
warmly. Many of the lyrics are perfect, and thematically the poem traverses
many of the issues which are at the heart of poetry today: from the modernist
legacy of deep worries over memory and metaphor, to a more contemporary
juxtaposition of dictions and registers, and a concern with post-modernism and
the end of history. It is a sequence which is not afraid to take on Stevens, or
Milton and Hardy and Auden. But I would like to see it slightly reshaped, for I
feel that there is a great poem hiding in here somewhere, if only I could be
persuaded more of its motivation. I think fear does lie at the heart of its
psychology, but the real fear is artistic rather than political; and if this
could be worked more into the texture of the poem, along with some editing of
the poem&rsquo;s middle section, we would have a major achievement not only in
Oliver&rsquo;s oeuvre, but in antipodean writing.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
